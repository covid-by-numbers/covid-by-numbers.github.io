## Updated graphs

The code for these graphs is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/covid-by-numbers/covid-by-numbers.github.io/tree/main/code/00-UPD). These versions have been updated in the font and colours associated with the book. Some graphs also show more recent statistics. The latest update was on 3rd March 2022.
