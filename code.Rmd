## Code and graphs

Each link will take to the GitHub repository, where there is the R code and spreadsheets used to create the original graphs.

These graphs are in grey-scale. There are also some colour versions created for presentations by the authors. In addition, there is code for graphs cut from published versions of the book. In the book itself, graphs were remade in the house style, so the appearance differs.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
